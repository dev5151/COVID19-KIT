TEAM BruteForce - Crack the Covid-19 Crisis Hackathon

Our solution consist of two parts:

1.	First part is a remote education android app which resolves all the problem stated above. It contains all the features a student will want in his/her app. We tried to involve every activity that we use to do in offline college times in this App.
It consists of Video call functionality with a special feature of blocking students who are speaking abusive or bad words during a live session. The student will be reported to the admin of the app and all the records of the blocked student will be sent to the admin app. Admin can unblock the student again. 
Then our app contains a chat room for each classroom a student is enrolled in, it will allow the students and teachers to communicate as they use to do in Offline College.
Then comes the appointment feature. Before contacting any teacher we have to make an appointment with him/her to ask for their time. So our App includes this cool feature of appointment for the students. This reduces the chaos and brings the working thing so that follows proper protocol.
Teachers wanted an invigilation system to invigilate students during the test. In our App we provided this feature by camera proctored examination feature. Under this a teacher can proctor all students through their webcams while the students are giving tests, also the teacher can pass their voice in the whole class to convey messages during tests.
Also our app has a feature of assignment submission. The teachers can upload the assignment questions along with the due date and students on the other hand can upload the solutions of these tests on the app itself.
 
2.	Our second part of the solution consists of an IoT device, an Image algorithm, and an android app. combining all makes a ROBOCARE package for helping Covid19 doctors and patients. 
To help treat Covid19 patients we invented a robot that can be used as an essentials deliverable device or like a wheelchair. The robot work on the gesture made by hands. We don’t have to touch anything to operate the robot just make gestures and transfer medicines and food to patients through this robot. 
Due to Covid19 treatment people are becoming weak so this robot can act as a wheelchair also for easy transportation through mere gestures.
 
Also we devised an IOT device that will measure the temperature and heartbeat of the patient and will transfer all this data to the cloud which is connected with an App that will be updated on a real-time basis and will give alerts to doctor. This will help in social distancing treatment.
Through our Image processing algorithm, we will allow the patients to make some face gesture and through these gestures, an alarm will ring in the doctor’s phone having our android App.

Along with this we have a covid19 case detector ( https://public.tableau.com/profile/elio.jordan.lopes#!/vizhome/COVID-19-TRACKER-ELIO/COVID19DASHBOARD?publish=yes ) .
